# PnM

Hi everyone!

In the spirit of collaboration, I have made a github repository for our team.

This will be the designated repository for present r-related endevours for the meantime, as I do not know if we are allowed to create
github accounts on our company emails.

Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, insights, etc.

To progress and innovation
